# olive_player
Personal python music player that i started creating late 2020 (Not finished) before i started my professional life.

This project was a way for me to work with python.
I used Flask and SQLAlchemy

It lets me create/edit/delete my playlists and add/remove music to queue.
Also has an authorization middleware.

olive_aux_ has all de scripts that i needed to create an xml file that had all the music files and all the playlists that i had already created on Groove Music aswell as all the new playlists created with this api.
example of xml file -> db_2020-12-20 16h06m16.522238s.xml

Missing front-end;
Missing streaming mp3 file, right now it is sending the full mp3 file
